# UART_FIFO

Real Time Serial Data Reception on FPGA using UART with FIFO Buffering

The project involves designing a UART receiver on an FPGA(basys 3 board) to receive serial data from a PC-based 
UART transmitter. The received data is sequentially loaded into a synchronous FIFO for reliable buffering and 
subsequent processing. This setup enables robust data acquisition from a standard PC terminal to an FPGA platform.
